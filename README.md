# Orbit Simulation

So, this is a very early concept of an orbit simulation.

Things you can currently do:

- Add objects with various variables
- Remove objects
- Watch the planets do orbit-stuff

Things I want to add in the future:

- Force-Indicators between bodies
- Better UI (!important)
- Changing values of bodies dynamically
- Showing paths, including an orbit-preview

And... thats it for now, theres really not that much to do currently :(
